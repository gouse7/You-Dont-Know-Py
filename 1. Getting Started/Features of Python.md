Features of a language are nothing but, `services or facilities` provided by language developers. They are available in languages, used by language programmers.

There are **11 features** provided by python

-   **Simple Programming Language**
    
    Because of 3 Technical Factors
    1.  Factor 1 - Rich Set of Modules
        -   Module is collection of functions, Attributes and class names
        -   Examples: calendar, math, threading, qrcode, os, random
    2.  Factor 2 - Memory Management
        -   Garbage collection
    3.  Factor 3 -
-   **Freeware and open source**
    
    Freely downloadable software is a freeware
    
    Ex: python, java
    
    Open Source: Customized freeware software which is open to accept any changes, comes under open source
    
    Ex: JPython (Jython - Java), Iron Python(C#, .Net), Ruby Python, Micro Python, Anaconda Python (Run Big Data applications, Hadoop), StackLess Python
    
-   **Platform independent language**
    
    Data Types are objects
    
    Class and Object based
    
    Unlimited data holding in objects
    
-   **Dynamically typed language**
    
    There are two types of languages,
    
    -   What are **Static Typed languages**
        
        Ex: C, C++, Java
        
    -   What are **Dynamically Typed**
        
        type is not needed to specify, it will be automatically defined by python
        
-   Interpreted Programming Language
    
-   High Level
    
-   Robust (Strong)
    
-   Both Functional and Object Oriented Language
    
-   Extensible
    
-   Embedded
    
-   Supports third party APIs such as NumPY, pandas
