## Purpose of Files in Python

The purpose of files in Python is to facilitate data persistence and enable efficient input/output operations. Here are some key points regarding the purpose of files in Python:

1. **Data Persistence**: Files provide a means to store data permanently in secondary memory (HDD) and retrieve it later. By using files, Python programs can store data beyond the lifetime of the program's execution.

2. **Input/Output Operations**: Files enable reading data from external sources and writing data to external destinations. This allows Python programs to interact with files, which can be text files or binary files, to perform various operations such as reading, writing, appending, and modifying data.

3. **Data Sharing**: Files provide a common and standardized way to share data between different programs and systems. Data stored in files can be easily accessed and processed by other programs or even different programming languages.

4. **Data Organization**: Files allow for structured organization of data. Data can be organized into records, which can be accessed individually or sequentially. This enables efficient storage and retrieval of data, especially when dealing with large amounts of information.

5. **Data Backup and Recovery**: Files serve as a backup mechanism for data. By storing data in files, it becomes possible to recover and restore data in case of system failures, program crashes, or other unforeseen events.

6. **Data Exchange**: Files are widely used for data exchange between different systems or platforms. Data can be saved in a file format that is compatible with other software applications, making it easier to share and collaborate on data across different environments.

## Types of Applications
- The purpose of files in any programming language is to maintain data persistence.
- Data persistence refers to the process of storing data permanently.
- Based on data persistence, we can develop two types of applications:
  1. **Non-Persistent Applications**:
     - In non-persistent applications, data is read from the keyboard, stored in the main memory (RAM) as objects, processed, and the results are displayed on the monitor.
     - Examples: All the previous examples fall under non-persistent applications.
     - Data stored in the main memory (RAM) is temporary and not persisted beyond the runtime of the application.
  2. **Persistent Applications**:
     - In persistent applications, data is read from the keyboard, stored in the main memory (RAM) as objects, processed, and the results are stored permanently.
     - In the industry, there are two ways to store data permanently:
       1. By using files: Data can be stored permanently in files. Files provide a means of storing and retrieving data from secondary memory (HDD).
       2. By using RDBMS Database Software: Data can be stored permanently in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) software such as Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, DB2, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, etc. These databases offer robust and structured storage options for persistent data.


## File and Stream Definitions


### Definition of Stream:
- The flow of data between objects in the main memory and files in the secondary memory is called a stream.
