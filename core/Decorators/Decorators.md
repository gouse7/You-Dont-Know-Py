In Python, a decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another function without changing its source code. Decorators provide a way to add or modify the functionality of a function by wrapping it with another function.

## Explanation

Decorators are a way of modifying or enhancing the functionality of an existing function. They allow you to add new behavior to a function without modifying its source code. Decorators are useful when you want to add common functionality to several functions or when you want to separate concerns in your code.

## Syntax

The syntax for defining a decorator is as follows:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before the function is called
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after the function is called
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def my_function():
    # do something
```

In the above example, `my_decorator` is a function that takes another function `func` as its argument and returns a new function `wrapper`. The `wrapper` function wraps the original function `func` and adds new behavior to it. The `@my_decorator` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `my_function` function.

## Example

Here's an example of a decorator that logs the execution time of a function:

```python
import time

def log_time(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_time
def my_function():
    # do something

my_function()
```

In this example, the `log_time` decorator takes a function `func` as its argument and returns a new function `wrapper` that logs the execution time of the original function. The `@log_time` syntax is used to apply the decorator to the `my_function` function.

## Pitfalls

Here are some potential pitfalls to keep in mind when using decorators:

- Decorators can make code harder to read and debug if they are used excessively or if they are poorly implemented.
- Decorators can add overhead to function calls, which can affect performance if they are used extensively.
- Decorators can change the behavior of a function in unexpected ways, especially if they are applied to functions that are used in multiple places in the code.
- Decorators can make it harder to write unit tests for functions, especially if the decorator modifies the function's input or output.
